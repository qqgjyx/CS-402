    "1. **(i) Depth-first optimal:** $\\boxed{\\text{FALSE}}$\n",
    "   - *Justification:* DFS explores one path completely before backtracking. Even with consistent heuristics, it doesn't guarantee optimality.\n",

    "3. **(iii) Uniform-cost optimal:** $\\boxed{\\text{TRUE}}$\n",
    "   - *Justification:* UCS explores nodes in order of increasing g(n). It's optimal for any cost function.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **(iv) Greedy optimal:** $\\boxed{\\text{FALSE}}$\n",
    "   - *Justification:* Greedy uses only h(n), ignoring g(n). Even with consistent heuristics, it's not optimal.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **(v) A* optimal:** $\\boxed{\\text{TRUE}}$\n",
    "   - *Justification:* A* uses f(n) = g(n) + h(n). With consistent (and thus admissible) heuristics, A* is guaranteed optimal.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **(vi) A* ≤ DFS nodes:** $\\boxed{\\text{FALSE}}$\n",
    "   - *Justification:* DFS may find a solution by expanding fewer nodes than A*, but that solution might be suboptimal. A* guarantees optimality but may need to expand more nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **(vii) A* ≤ UCS nodes:** $\\boxed{\\text{TRUE}}$\n",

    "## Answers:\n",
    "1. **(i) h2 optimal solution:** $\\boxed{\\text{FALSE}}$\n",
    "   - *Justification:* h2 = 2h1 is NOT admissible because it overestimates by a factor of 2. A* with non-admissible heuristics is not guaranteed optimal.\n",
